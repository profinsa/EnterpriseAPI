all tools is commandline, because of their execution time. How long tool works depends of how many data
in database. Commanline can work as long as it need.

To call any tool you need open cmd.exe, change directory to Enterprise\tools like that:
cd C:\\Cloud\Dropbox\live\wwwroot\EnterpriseX\tools
and execute tools like that:

php AuditLoginPurge.php

  DEFAULT, DEMO
  examples:
  php AuditLoginPurge.php DINOS DEFAULT DEFALT
  delete records for DINOS DEFAULT DEFAULT
  
  php AuditLoginPurge.php ALL
  delete records for ALL companies, division and departments excep DINOS, DEFAULT, DEMO and their divisions
  and departments
* AuditTrailPurge.php
