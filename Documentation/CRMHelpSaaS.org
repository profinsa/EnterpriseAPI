* CRM
  Newsletter subscribe and View Demo Handler with entering Customer information is implemented by two ways:
  - server side logic
    implemented in EnterpriseX project in Help controller(controllers/help.php). It uses EnterpriseX LeadInformation
    model to work with data - getting, updating, inserting
  - client side logic
    + Subscribe form is same as it was in past, but now it uses differ address and point to EnterpriseX/index.php?page=help 
      For this case can be used any just html form with inputs which will send form data to EnterpriseX. Example of form in
      Documentation/examples/subscribeForm.html
      If you need put form like it on your site - you need change sending address on own.
    + View Demo Handler is mix of some html and js for working with EnterpriseX Help over AJAX requests.
      Code of View Demo Hanlder in Documentation/examples/ViewDemoHandler.html
      This component is simple. Just html for button and forms and some javascript for working with button, forms and sending
      AJAX requests.

   How it works?:
   Client enter email on subscribe form, then click on subscribe. Form sends data to EnterpriseX which uses Help controller to
   handle data. It sends confirmation email to client which contains link to EnterpriseX Help controller with confirmation info.
   When user click on link, Help controller calls LeanInformation to insert Lead data

   Client click on View demo. System checks cookies and if they contains customer info - just open Application. If not it
   opens Customer Creation form. Client fill the form and click send. Request is sent to EnterpriseX Help controller, which
   uses LeadInformation model to create Customer and send customer cookies back.  Client is redirected to opened Application.

* Help Module 
  Help module is part of EnterpriseX and uses Help controler to work.
  If you need help tickets feature - you need to create another database, load cleanenterprise to it and create config as
  clone of EnterpriseX/common.php, EnterpriseX/help.php for example. To use this database you need open it in Browser as
  EnterpriseX/index.php?page=login&config=help.php. Then you need change default passwords of users to avoid access to data
  for someone else.
  Any installations which you own can point to you ticket system. For this you need to edit each config of your installation and
  change following parameters:
  "supportLink" => "https://stfb.net/EnterpriseX/index.php?config=STFBEnterprise",
  "supportInsertUser" => [
  supportLink is link to your EnterpriseX installation which will store support requests
  supportInsertUser is credentials for user which had access to insert support requests

* SaaS Module
  SaaS Module is part of EnterpriseX. That means any EnterpriseX installation potencially can create other EnterpriseX installations,
  sell it and expose to users. But SaaS Module had own security, if user don't have right he don't see SaaS functions.
  + Hosting Manager
    For creating installations(databases) SaaS module uses EnterpriseX/tools/HostingManager. This tool need to execute from
    command like like:
    php HostingManager.php
    Also you need to Edit first line of HostingManager.php to change config name to another from Admin, if you use other config
    name for SaaS Module.
    That's all, Hosting Manager will create new databases and loads images to it.
  + HostingCart
    HostingCart is part of EnterpriseX/Cart application
    by default it uses EnterpriseX/Cart/AppShop.php config
    you need change CompanyID, DivisionID, DepartmentID, User and Pass if you using other
    Also you can change database, for default it enterpriseadmin
    When client uses HostingCart he uses it as regular Cart but Hosting Cart uses additional EnterpriseX features for creating
    installations. Created installations is just databases with own configs. Each created installation just like default, but 
    created installations don't have Admin part because of he don't have rights and don't have own Hosting Manager. Technically
    we can allow to each new installation to have own Hosting Manager and create own installation if it will need to someone.
