* system requirements
   + Mysql >= 5.5 or MS SQL Server
   + php 5.6(may be higher, but not tested yet)
   + iis version 6 or higher
   + iis php module 5.6 version
*  installation for Mysql
   + unpack in some place which accesable for webserver, for example it may be C:\inetpub\EnterpriseUniversalAPI
     It means that address in browser will be something like that: localhost\EnterpriseX
   + create database enterprise and user for that database with full permissions. 
     For example this user will be "enteprise" with password "enterprisepass"
     You need change config values for mysqld([mysqld] section) in my.cnf:
     - lower_case_table_names = 1
     - max_allowed_packet = 64M
     - wait_timeout = 600
   + load database from database/backups/enterprise.sql
     like that mysql -u enteprise -p enterprise < database/backups/enterprise.sql
   + change database settings in app/common.php
     - change db_host if it need
     - change db_user to enterprise
     - change db_password to enterprisepass
     - change db_base to enterprise

   If all steps is done, you can go to browser, type localhost/EnterpriseX/index.php and you will see login page
   
* installation for MS SQL Server
   + install PHP Tools over Visual Studio -> Menu -> Manage Extensions
   + install MS Web Platform installer(tool for installtion Web Platform components like PHP, Microsoft Drivers for PHP for SQL server etc)
   + install PHP, Microsoft Drivers for PHP for SQL Server on IISExpress, Microsoft Drivers for PHP for SQL Server on IIS. 
     ALl this components must have same version. You can install these components with MS Web Platform installer
   + unpack in some place which accesable for webserver, for example it may be C:\inetpub\EnterpriseUniversalAPI
     That means that address in browser will be something like that: localhost\EnterpriseUniversalAPI
   + restore Enterprise database from Enterprise Cloud version
   + change rights to EnterpriseUniversalAPI and Windows/Temp - allow read and write to Users and IIS Users

   Then you can folow two different ways:
   + start project from Visual Studio
     - open solution in Visual Studio
     - run
   + start project from IIS(this is Windows Server way)
     - just open localhost/EnterpriseUniversalAPI/examples/list.html in browser
