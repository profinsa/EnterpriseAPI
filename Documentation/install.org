     It means that address in browser will be something like that: localhost\EnterpriseX
   + create database myenterprise and user for that database with full permissions. 
     For example this user will be "enteprise" with password "enterprisepass"
     You need change config values for mysqld([mysqld] section) in my.cnf:
     - lower_case_table_names = 1
     - max_allowed_packet = 64M
     - wait_timeout = 600
   + load database from database/backups/enterprise.sql
     like that mysql -u enteprise -p enterprise < database/backups/enterprise.sql
   + change database settings in app/common.php
     - change db_host if it need
     - change db_user to enterprise
     - change db_password to enterprisepass
     - change db_base to enterprise

   If all steps is done, you can go to browser, type localhost/EnterpriseX/index.php and you will see login page
