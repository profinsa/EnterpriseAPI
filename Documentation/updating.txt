To update application you need to do two steps
1) git pull  - to pull and merge all changes from repository
2) load all mysql files with updates from database/updates/ directory which have bigger date than value from select value from databaseinfo WHERE id='Version';

1)You can use any git client to do it, but i recommed to use something convenient to resolve conflicts in files if you will change code. Tools like command line Git client or built-in git client in Visual Studio Code are best to do it.
2) Best way - using command line mysql client like that: mysql -uuser -p enterprise < database/update/update_2020_01_01.sql
