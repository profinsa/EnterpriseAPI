When user click on process, code, starting from line:
 $("#confirmButton").click(     function(){
is executed.

This code calls AccountsReceivable/OrderScreens/ViewOrders", "getNewItemAllRemote
from EnterpriseX/models/EnterpriseASPAR/OrderProcessing/OrderHeaderList.php which inherit from gridDataSource.php which contains code getNewItemAllRemote.

Then code calls insertItemRemote from same OrderHeaderList.php.
Then code calls getNewItemAllRemote and insertItemsRemote from EnterpriseX/models/EnterpriseASPAR/OrderProcessing/OrderDetail.php

Then code calls Recals from OrderHeaderList.php to recalc order.

In many places of project we using virtual paths like AccountsReceivable/OrderScreens/ViewOrders, to map it to real models you need to check file - EnterpriseX/models/menuIdToHref.php
