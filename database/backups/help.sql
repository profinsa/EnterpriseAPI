Sometimes security patches from&nbsp;Microsoft change some settings that effect the way that the system handles Dot Net applications.\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>First, on any Windows Server Boxes, PLEASE be sure to use the&nbsp;Windows Update Tool to bring the system current before you begin your installation, or different errors can be  introduced. If your system is running error free and you run the Windows Update then get the above error, then this error was most likely the one that was introduced.\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Security can be reset using the following procedure:\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<div>Go to IIS, and go to the IIS web site Properties\r\n    <br/>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>Select Directory Security\r\n    <br/>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>Select Authentication and Access Control\r\n    <br/>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>Click the Click Edit Button and the Authentication Methods Tab comes up\r\n    <br/>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>Make sure that Enable Anonymous Access is ticked\r\n    <br/>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>User Name should be YOUR_SERVERNAME\\IUSR_YOUR_SERVERNAME\r\n    <br/>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>The Password needs to be reset\r\n    <br/>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Now go to Active Directory Users or [Computer Management - Local Users &amp; Groups if not using Active Directory]\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<div>Select the User IUSR - Internet Guest Account\r\n    <br/>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>Reset the password to the one you just typed in under IIS - Authentication Methods\r\n    <br/>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>This should correct the problem. If not, proceed to the fourth cause.\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <b>\r\n        <br/>Fourth Cause (User Issues)\r\n    </b>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>When you install the Windows Server&nbsp;System, the system will create a system name and create users for the system with the proper permissions. However, if you change the system name at some point in the future, the system handles the name change properly, but does not recreate the system users with the proper permissions. As a result, many of the system accounts, including the one necessary for running Dot Net apps, will no longer work.\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>You should make sure that during Initial System Installation, you are selecting the correct system name and that this will not change.\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>If you do change the name of the system, you will need to do one of the following:\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>1) Re-Create all of the system users with their proper permissions\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>- or -\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>2) Re-Install Windows and give the proper system name at installation.\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>The Microsoft Knowledge Base also has a review of the errors of this type that you can find by searching the site for the exact error message displayed.\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>If the problem is not caused by the previous causes listed above, then the problem may be with the Dot Net framework. If you had an early Dot Net Framework installed on your computer and upgraded it to version 2.0, or you have 2.0 and have upgraded to a higher version, sometimes a problem occurs during the upgrade process that can cause errors. If you are getting the error mentioned above and other unexplained errors and problems with the newly installed Dot Net Framework, uninstall the Dot Net Framework and all the programs that depend upon it, re-install the dot net framework, then install the programs that depend upon the dot net framework.&nbsp;\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<div>\r\n    <b>\r\n        <br/>\r\n        <b>The \"GetCompanies()\" Variety of 401 Error</b>\r\n        <br/>\r\n    </b>When you receive the 401 Error and in the body of the error message it is stated that the failure was with the \"GetCompanies()\" command, this means that the front-end ASP Dot Net app can not connect to either the web services or the web services could not connect to the back-end database. This error occurs if you change the configuration of the application, like changing the location of one of the application layers, or changing the default users or the default password without making the required adjustments in the web.config file or the application.config file.

If there is not enough inventory to fill all or part of the order, then the order will receive backorder status and will be listed in the Backorders screen. If an order is backordered, it will not be able to be picked or packed since there is no inventory to pick or ship.</p>\r\n<p>To view the current backorders in the system, from the Accounts Receivable menu, select Backorder. This will bring you to a screen with a list of the current back orders. From this screen, you can review and/or print the backorders, and do one of two things to them. You can Reallocate a backorder or you can Split a backorder.</p>\r\n<p>To Reallocate a backorder, click the reallocate button next to the backorder you wish to reallocate. Reallocating a backorder is the process of resubmitting it to see if enough inventory is available to fill the order. This is usually done after a purchase order is received, returns were received, or orders were cancelled. The backorder is compared with the inventory on hand. If the order can be completely fulfilled it will be moved to the picking screen. If the order still has items on back order, then it will be displayed in the backorder screen. The numbers on the order will be adjusted accordingly to show the amount of inventory on hand (if any) that can be allocated to the order. From this point, you can either leave the backorder as is, or if there is partial inventory on hand to fill the order, you can Split the backorder.</p>\r\n<p>Splitting a backorder separates the order into two separate orders. A new order is created with the item amounts that can be allocated to inventory. This order is sent to be picked and packed. The original order has the balance of the items on backorder and remains in backorder status. To Split an order, click the split button next to the order that you wish to split. Once the split button is clicked, the first order that has the allocated inventory disappears from the backorder screen and will appear in the Picking screen and the second order remains in the Backorder screen.</p>\r\n<p>For example: There is a backorder for 10 widgets and you know that 7 of the 10 were just received from an outstanding purchase order earlier in the day. You click Reallocate and the order is returned showing that there are 7 widgets on hand and allocated for the order, and there are still 3 widgets on backorder. Then you click split and the order is separated. The first order is sent with 7 widgets listed as the order quantity to be filled and shipped to the customer. The second order which the system creates places the 3 widgets on backorder status. This backorder will remain as such until you reallocate it (when additional inventory arrives) or the order is cancelled.</p>\r\n                </article>',NULL,NULL),('STFB','DEFAULT','DEFAULT','BankReconciliation','Bank Reconciliation','USER','GL',NULL,'<div>\r\n    <span class=\"size\" style=\"font-size:medium\">\r\n        <b>Bank Account Reconciliation</b>\r\n    </span>\r\n    <br/>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>Bank Account Reconciliation is the process by which you compare the information in the company\'s records with the statements provided each month by the bank for the bank account and balance the difference so that the bank\'s records and the company\'s records balance.\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>The Integral Accounting Enterprise system makes bank reconciliation an easy process. To access the bank reconciliation screen, from the main menu click General Ledger then click Banking then click Reconcile Bank Accounts. A screen will be displayed that contains the company\'s bank accounts ready to be reconciled. If no bank accounts have been reconciled yet, then the default record will be displayed until the first bank reconciliation is entered.\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <b>Creating the Bank Reconciliation for the First Time</b>\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>If a bank account to be reconciled does not appear on the Bank Reconciliation screen, then that account will need to be added to the screen. To do this, from the main Bank Reconciliation screen, click the New button. This will bring up a screen where you can select the bank account for the new bank reconciliation.&nbsp;\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>From the drop down list in the field Bank ID, select the name of the bank account that you are setting up the bank reconciliation for. The information will be automatically populated in the fields but you will not be able to edit it. This is only to confirm that the information is correct for the bank account selected and to add the information to the table in the system. Click CLOSE to save the newly created reconciliation and return to the Bank Reconciliation list and proceed to the next step, reconciling the bank account.\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <b>Reconciling Bank Accounts</b>\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Select the bank account from the Bank Reconciliation List to begin the reconciliation process.\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>After clicking the bank account to be reconciled, the Bank Account Reconciliation Detail screen is displayed. From this screen there are two separate screens displaying the debit and credit transactions for that bank account, fields on the main screen to enter service charges and adjustments to balance the account, and a display on the right showing the current balance in the company\'s \"books\".\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>The data displaying the company balances cannot be edited, it retrieves the information based on the balances in the system automatically.\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>There are four steps to reconciling a bank account. They should be completed in order to ensure accuracy of the bank reconciliation.\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>1. Review the previous bank reconciliation and retrieve the current bank statement\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>The first step is to ensure that the actual bank statement to be reconciled from the bank is available. Also, you may want to review the previous bank reconciliation before beginning a new bank reconciliation.\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>To review the previous bank reconciliation on an account, select General Ledger from the main menu, then View Bank Reconciliations. From that screen, all the bank reconciliations previously entered into the Integral Accounting Enterprise system can be reviewed. Further information about the Bank Reconciliation Summary Screen can be found in the corresponding documentation section.\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>2. Enter initial information from the bank statement\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Next, enter the Reconciliation Start Date, Reconciliation End Date and the Ending Balance as shown on the Bank Statement. Detailed information about these fields and the remaining fields are listed below. Do not enter information into the other fields yet. They will be reviewed later in the reconciliation process. When you enter the amount in the Ending Balance field, you will notice that the box on the right side of the screen that says \"Stmt Balance\" is updated with the amount you just entered. This reflects the balance shown on the bank statement.\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>3. Compare and Clear Transactions with the Bank Statement\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>The third step in reconciling the bank account is to compare and clear all the debit and credit transactions on the company\'s books with those that were processed by the bank and displayed on the bank statement. First, click the Credit button to display the screen listing the Credit Transactions. Review each transaction individually to ensure what is displayed on the screen and entered in the system corresponds with the bank statement. If the data corresponds, check off the box next to that transaction. This indicates that the transaction is accurate and has \"cleared\" the bank.\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>If the transaction is different then what is shown on the bank statement, then research needs to be done to find the difference and enter an adjustment to correct the error. If the transaction displayed in the system does not accurately match what is on the bank statement, then the transaction should not be checked off.\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Note: If a transaction is not marked as \"cleared\" it will reappear on the next bank reconciliation.&nbsp;\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>As the transactions are checked off, the Company\'s book balances displayed on the screen are automatically updated to reflect the current balance.\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Once all the Credit transactions have been reviewed and cleared, click the Debit button to display the screen listing the Debit Transactions. As with the Credit transactions, review the list and check off each box if the transaction has cleared the bank. As the transactions are checked off, the Company\'s book balances displayed on the screen are automatically updated to reflect the current balance.\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>When you are finished selecting the Debit transactions, click the Main button to return to the main bank reconciliation screen.\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>4. Enter additional transactions if needed\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>The last step in the Bank Reconciliation process is to enter any transactions that appear on the bank statement but have not been recorded in the system on the company\'s records. These transactions may include service charges, interest, or other charges and adjustments. Enter each amount in the field on the main screen, and select the GL Account where the transaction should be posted. Further information on each field is listed in detail below.\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>As with clearing the debit and credit transactions, when entering additional transactions in the respective fields, the book balance display is automatically updated.\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>5. Posting the Bank Reconciliation to the GL\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>When you are finished working with the bank reconciliation and ready to post the transactions to the General Ledger, click the Post button to post the bank reconciliation to the GL. Posting the bank reconciliation to the GL record the service charge transactions, adjusting entries (if any) and additional transactions entered during the bank reconciliation process. You can print the bank reconciliation at any time by clicking the Print button.\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Note: You must click the post button to post the bank reconciliation to the General Ledger and record the adjusting transactions entered for the bank account.&nbsp;\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <b>Main Section Fields</b>\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Bank ID: This field is automatically completed based on the Bank Account selected.&nbsp;\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Reconciliation Start Date: This field is automatically completed by default to be 30 days prior to the date you are entering the bank reconciliation.

This is an ideal set-up for companies with many independent divisions and departments. Each division and department within an organization can record and manage their own General Ledger and corporate data.\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Therefore, a company has a division and a division has a department. Each department is it\'s own entity with it\'s own general ledger, customer list, vendor list, etc. Each division can be set up the same way, as a separate entity with it\'s own general ledger, customer list, etc.\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Whenever you are working within Integral Accounting Enterprise, you are always in a Company and a division and a department related to that company.

Incorrect selection of an account can result in inaccurate reporting.&nbsp;\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>The drop down lists are populated from the Chart of Accounts. Therefore, it is extremely important that the Chart of Accounts be reviewed and/or edited if need be before selecting the General Ledger Accounts.

Accounting Periods are the way a company divides their fiscal year into smaller portions. Some common accounting periods companies use are quarterly, monthly, and dividing the year into 13 equal portions. Integral Accounting Enterprise supports all of these common formats, as well as any other division with 14 or fewer periods. The 14th fiscal period is available as an \"extra\" fiscal period for entering adjusting entries, or end of year transactions.\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Fiscal Start Date: In this field, enter the starting date of the fiscal year for the Company.&nbsp;\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Fiscal End Date: In this field, enter the ending date of the fiscal year for the Company.\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Current Fiscal Year: In this field, enter the current fiscal year for the Company.\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Current Period: In this field, enter the current open fiscal period for the Company.\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>In the remaining periods, enter the ending dates for each fiscal period that the company has. The number of fiscal periods entered depends on how many fiscal periods the company has. Do not check off the boxes under each period date.

However, in order to receive the full benefit of the multi-currency feature, and to ensure accurate reporting, steps must be taken to set up the system properly. Follow the procedures outlined below to correctly set up and use the multi-currency feature in the Integral Accounting Enterprise system.</p>\r\n<p><strong>1. Confirm the default currency for the company.&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p>The default currency is selected during the company setup process. Therefore, this step will confirm that the proper default currency is selected in the company screen. To do this go into System Setup then Company Setup then click Company Setup again. Select your company from the list and click on the pencil to edit/view the company. Once the Company screen loads, click the Defaults tab at the top of the screen. This will bring up the default settings for this company.</p>\r\n<p>The first line is the Currency ID which determines the default currency for this company. This should already be selected to the native currency that your company does business in. If not, select the proper currency from the drop down list.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>If your company/division/department does not need or use the multi-currency feature, then there is nothing more that needs to be done. Otherwise, follow the steps below to set up the system for multi-currency accounting.</p>\r\n<p><strong>2. Determine the GL Account for the Currency Gains and Losses</strong></p>\r\n<p>The Integral Accounting Enterprise system is shipped with default data. Included in the default data is a Chart of Accounts (CoA) which includes a realized and unrealized default GL Account for the Multi-Currency feature. If your company is going to use the default GL account that comes with the system, then you can skip this step and proceed to step 3. If your company is going to use a different GL Account for the Currency Gains and Losses, then set up the new Currency Gain and Loss account at this time. Refer to the user manual under the section titled General Ledger for more information on setting up a new account in the General Ledger.</p>\r\n<p><strong>3. Select the default GL Accounts for the Currency Gains and Losses</strong></p>\r\n<p>In this step, you will select the General Ledger Accounts for the Currency gains and losses. From the Company Setup screen, click the Accounts tab. This will bring up the screen with a list of default accounts for the Company. The GL Currency Gain Loss Account can be found towards the bottom of the list. The default account of 490000 Realized Gains and Losses should already be selected for this account. If this is not the account you want to use, or if you created your own, then select it from the drop down list .</p>\r\n<p>Next, select the GL Currency Unrealized Gain Loss Account. It is located immediately under the GL Currency Gain Loss Account and has 491000 Unrealized Gains &amp; Losses selected as the default account. If this is not the account you want to use, or if you created your own, select it from the drop down list.</p>\r\n<p>When you have finished selecting the default GL Accounts for the Currency Gains and Losses, click OK to exit the Company Accounts screen.</p>\r\n<p><strong>4. Enter the Currencies into the Currencies Table</strong></p>\r\n<p>Now that the accounts have been set up for the currency, the next step is to enter the currency values into the currencies table. You should enter the rates for all of the currencies that your company expects to conduct business in. The Integral Accounting Enterprise system is shipped with a small list of foreign currencies and sample currency exchange data only. To enter additional currencies and the current exchanges, go into the System Setup option from the main menu, then Company Setup. From there, click on the Currencies option and that will bring up the list of currencies entered into the system.</p>\r\n<p>To enter a new currency record, click the New button at the top of the screen. A screen will come up where you can enter the information for a new currency record.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>To edit an existing currency record, click the edit button (the pencil) next to the currency record to bring up that currency\'s record. From there, you can edit the current exchange of the currency.</p>\r\n<p>Note: The currency exchange rates that are shipped with the system are SAMPLE rates only. They are not accurate nor current and MUST be changed prior to use.</p>\r\n<p>You can manually update the currency exchange rates on a regular basis or as often as your company sees fit.</p>\r\n<p>Note: There is no automated method to update the currency exchange rates. The only way to update them and ensure they are current and accurate is to update them manually.</p>\r\n<p>There are many different ways of obtaining the current currency exchange rates and you should use the method that works best for you. XE.com (http://www.xe.com) is free a website that has the current currency exchange rates in real-time with an automatic refresh of the page every few minutes. You can also sign up for their email subscription service to receive the currency exchange rates daily by email.</p>\r\n<p>Each time the currency exchange rates are changed, the old rate and the date the rate was changed will automatically go into the Currency Rates History Table. If you enter a transaction for an older date, the system will automatically use the rate from the Currency Rates History Table as of the transaction date, even if the date is in the past. For example, if a transaction was entered on March 15, 2004, but the date on the transaction is entered as March 1, 2004, the system will select the currency exchange rate from the Currency History Table as of March 1, 2004.</p>\r\n<p>In any event, the system automatically uses the most current exchange rate as of the transaction date entered in the system.</p>\r\n<p>Note: In following with GAAP Compliancy, currency amounts are set to and converted to the company default currency at the current exchange rate before posting.</p>\r\n<p><strong>5. Set up bank and General Ledger accounts as needed for the currencies</strong></p>\r\n<p>After the current currency exchange rates are entered into the Currencies Table, the next step is to create a separate bank account and a separate General Ledger cash account in the system for each of the currencies that your company deals in. Each of these bank accounts should point to a cash account in the General Ledger.</p>\r\n<p>You would set up the bank accounts in the company setup screen just as you set up all the other bank accounts. Additionally, you would set up the General Ledger Cash accounts just as you set up other General Ledger accounts.</p>\r\n<p>For more information on setting up bank accounts and General Ledger accounts, please refer to the section titled Banking under General Ledger and General Ledger Posting Guide, respectively, in the User Manual.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Congratulations!</strong></p>\r\n<p>You have successfully completed setting up the multi-currency feature of the Integral Accounting Enterprise system. The rest of the steps are automatically handled by the system. When entering transactions, be sure to select the proper currency from the Currency ID drop down lists. The system will automatically complete the current exchange rate when the transaction is entered. When the transaction is paid, or cash is received for that transaction, the system will calculate the rate and make the proper posting to the Realized Currency Gain / Loss account in the Chart of Accounts.</p>\r\n                </article>',NULL,NULL),('STFB','DEFAULT','DEFAULT','CustomizingTheSoftware','Customizing The Software','TECH','SYS',NULL,'<div>\r\n    <b>\r\n        <span class=\"size\" style=\"font-size:medium\">Modifying the Integral Accounting Enterprise System</span>\r\n    </b>\r\n    <br/>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n    <br/>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>Integral Accounting Enterprise includes all of the source code for every part of the system.

If you follow these rules, it will be mush easier to re-integrate your changes into our future releases of the Integral Accounting Enterprise System:\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>1) Always back-up the system and / or the individual components that you are modifying before you make any changes or modifications to it.\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>2) You may add to the database in any way that you wish, but we recommend that you do not remove any fields from the database, or change any data types of any existing fields. We also recommend that you do not remove any of the existing tables.\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>3) When you make changes to any of our reports, we recommend that you give your changed and customized reports different names than ours.\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>4) If you make changes to the base classes, please make sure these changes are carefully documented and that you can reverse these changes if need be. All of your classes should be in separate class files in a different directory than our base class directory (\"Common\")\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>6) We recommend that if you make any code changes or modifications that you do this in accordance with the \"Customization Overview\" documents within this help system.

However, it is still a good idea to give your added&nbsp; stored procedures a custom prefix that will easily identify that stored procedure as a new one that was added during your customization process.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also always a good idea to back-up your custom changes to the stored procedures often.\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <b>Modifying an Existing Stored Procedure</b>\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>When modifying stored procedures that are included in the system, you should follow these simple guidelines to make sure that all of your custom changes to the stored procedures are preserved. If you are intend to add a lot of new logic to an existing stored procedure, you should instead add a new custom stored procedure to the system with the new logic, and reference it from the existing stored procedure. Then in the comments of the new stored procedure, you can make a note of the calling point to your new code so it can be easily replaced if lost. If these guidelines are followed, it would be an easy matter to replace the calling line in the new stored procedure to your existing code.\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>You should also keep a record in the comments of the stored procedure that you have changed or modified that stored procedure, so it can be easily copied into a different location and preserved in case it is accidentally overwritten.&nbsp;\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<div>\r\n    <br/>\r\n</div>',NULL,NULL),('STFB','DEFAULT','DEFAULT','DemoApplicationProblems','Demo Application Problems','TROUBLE','SYS',NULL,'<div>\r\n    <b>\r\n        <span class=\"size\" style=\"font-size:medium\">Most Common Demo Application Problems</span>\r\n    </b>\r\n    <br/>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <b>Live On-Line Demo Problems Common to All Applications</b>\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>The most common problem that we have reported with the Demo application is due to maintenance outages.

Some of these screens contain usefully information like:<br>\r\n - list of all created by Admin EnterpriseX applications <br>\r\n - list of errors from Customers installations <br>\r\n - lists of current, expiring, and expired customers <br>\r\n  - dashboards with most important statistics. <br>\r\n  - App Installation screen for working with installations and to manage it <br>\r\n  - any other screens for admin hoster convenience <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe SAAS Admin module acts as the backend for the Hosting Cart which is where customers sign-up for your hosted service\r\n<br><br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>EnterpriseXAdmin AJAX API</b> <br>\r\nThere is an EnterpriseXAdmin AJAX AI which performs the following tasks:<br>\r\n  - Checkout, all other processes like creating order, post etc are done over EnterpriseXAdmin using AJAX API\r\n   <br><br><br> \r\n\r\n<b>Hosting Manager</b> <br>\r\n  This module is consists from two parts. <br>\r\n  - as part of EnterpriseX Admin.  <br>\r\n  - as separated worker(script) which is executed as daemon(service) process <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  This module does following tasks: <br>\r\n  - creates new databases for customers <br>\r\n -  uploads cleanenterprise database into the customers database <br>\r\n -  grant privileges to db user <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince the database creation process takes some time, the new databases are created in advance by daemon. It always keeps about 5 fresh and ready to go databases with uploaded cleanenterprise image. We do this to allow the application to create a new installation fast, without lags because of uploading database image to database can take several minutes.\r\n<br><br>\r\nInformation about all the databases is written to appinstallation tables.\r\n<br><br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>Hosting Cart</b> <br>\r\nIt is special version of Enterprise X Cart application with own custom pages, designed specifically to support the hosting module. In most cases it will work just like the standard Enterprise X Shopping Cart. For example, all of the hosting item prices, and other information are taken from the InventoryItems table just like the regular cart. \r\n<br><br>\r\nThe  Hosting cart also loads the configuration for each different Hosting Product from Hosting Manager. Configuration for each product contains information like: <br>\r\n  + modules(Main, AR, AP, GL, Cart etc) for adding to product <br>\r\n  + list of included modules in price(for Trial version etc). <br>\r\n  When user chooser preffered modules, they are sent to Hosting Manager during checkout process <br>\r\n- checkout worked with EnterpriseX API(Create Order, Post, print doc) like regular Cart checkout process.  <br>\r\n  After checkouting, Hosting Cart send request to Hosting Manager to create application for user and receives uniq id for\r\n  application. <br>\r\n- Links to applications in Account <br>\r\n  Link is created from received uniq id for applications. When user click to Account or Account Page is result of checkout\r\n  procees Hosting Cart requests list of applications for Customer from Hosting Manager.  <br>\r\n  List of applications is list from uniq id, status and other information. <br>\r\n  Hosting cart creates table with applications information and links to applications.  <br>\r\n  Links are generated from uniq id and standard part of url like EnterpriseX/index.php?config=\r\n  Each application uses same application code EnterpriseX, but it uses different databases and configs. <br>\r\n <br> <br>\r\n    Hosting Cart uses AJAX API to do this: <br>\r\n    + creating applications as result of checkout process <br>\r\n    + listing of Customer applications and their status <br>\r\n    + changing access, shuting down and other things <br>\r\n    For doing it EnterpriseX Admin uses Hosting Manager because of some operations takes a time and cannot be done in request <br>\r\n    handler process, only in background process <br>\r\n\r\n <br> <br> <br>\r\n<b>Hosting Cart Scenario / WalkThrough </b> <br>\r\nHere are the basic steps and some of the calls that are used to create a new hosting customer <br>\r\nUser comes to your website <br>\r\nUser goes to Hosting Cart and does registration <br>\r\nSystem calls Cart EnterpriseX Admin API(this API is EnterpriseX) to create Customer and Customer Financials\r\nUser choose Hosting product, it’s added to Shopping Cart <br>\r\n       - Cart does it’s own calls to get list of products, add to cart etc.) <br>\r\n       - All Cart API uses inventoryitems table of enterpriseadmin database and other regular EnterpriseX tables directly.\r\nUser goes to checkout and click process <br>\r\n    - Cart call EnterpriseX Admin API(this API is EnterpriseX) to create Order, Post Order, Get Doc Order etc <br>\r\n    - Cart call EnterpriseX Admin API to make a request to create the Hosted Application.  <br>\r\n    - Freshly installed database is created and initialized it for new Hosting application. <br>\r\nUser can to go Manage Account <br>\r\n    - Hosting Cart calls own Cart API to get list of orders <br>\r\n    - Hosting Cart calls EnterpriseX Admin API to get list of the Customer Applications and their status <br>\r\nUser cab get and click on their Hosted Application link. Link looks like standard link - https://stfb.net/EnterpriseX/index.php?page=login&config=someconfig  <br>\r\n    - “someconfig” = the config param is unique id of Hosted Customer’s Hosted Application. <br>\r\n    - When the link is clicked, the Customer config and Customer database is loaded. <br>\r\n    - Application is now ready to go! <br>\r\n <br> <br> <br>\r\n\r\n<b>Hosting Manager Scenario</b> <br>\r\nHosting Manager daemon run continuously, and watches appinstallations table. If this table doesn\'t contains enough fresh and clean databases ready for installation, it creates a new fresh installation by creating a black database, and loading a cleanenterprise into it, then adds that entry to the appinstallations table. <br> <br>\r\nHosting manager is also responsible for deleting, saving and updating databases. It will do it so in the same way, as background process, because of all off these operations(creating, deleting, saving, updating) takes a lot of time and we don’t want the user just sitting there.  <br>\r\n\r\n','Demo','2019-09-05 09:16:22'),('STFB','DEFAULT','DEFAULT','EnterpriseXCpanelInstallation','Enterprise X Cpanel Installation Notes','INSTALL','SYS',NULL,'               <article>\r\n                    <div><b>Integral Accounting Enterprise X Cpanel Hosting</b><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>We have many customers asking about the hosting requirements for the Integral Accounting Enterprise X and if Enterprise X will run on cpanel-based hosts.&nbsp;<br></div><div><br></div><div><div>We did a lot of research on various hosting platforms regarding cpanel usage, &nbsp;This is what we have found:<br></div><div><br></div><div>There are multiple companies offering different kinds of cpanel servers, and not all of the cpanels have the same features.

Therefore, a thorough understanding of the Conceptual Framework is helpful and recommended.\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>The Conceptual Framework is the foundation for the standards set forth in accounting and from which GAAP is written. The Conceptual Framework explains and addresses the concepts of financial accounting such as why orders don\'t post to the GL, or why invoices can\'t be edited under GAAP. It also sets forth the basic principles as to the way transactions are recorded, when to record income and expenses, etc. Understanding the conceptual framework will help you understand GAAP better and ensure that when you customize and modify the software, it remains GAAP compliant. Chapter One in the Wiley GAAP Book details the history of GAAP, researching GAAP issues, and the Conceptual Framework.&nbsp;\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>There is no clear-cut checklist that details GAAP compliancy. In the back of the Wiley GAAP book, there is a Disclosure Checklist that sums up the policies and procedures for a company following GAAP. The checklist is rather large, and complex, covering concepts of accounting on a reporting and procedural level, rather then specific to accounting software. It is a good basis though, since it does detail certain things that should exist and occur (such as requirements that need to be on the financial statements) in an accounting system and is something that should be kept in mind when customizing Integral Accounting Enterprise.\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<div>Here is a summary of some of the compliance features in the Integral Accounting Enterprise Packages:\r\n    <br/>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n    <br/>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n    <div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- There is a complete audit trail in the Integral Accounting Enterprise system that tracks every change to every field.&nbsp;\r\n        <br/>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div>\r\n        <br/>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- The system keeps a history of all transactions within the system.&nbsp;\r\n        <br/>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div>\r\n        <br/>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- There is a second audit trail that tracks logins to the system&nbsp;\r\n        <br/>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div>\r\n        <br/>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- Transactions affecting the General Ledger cannot be edited or deleted.&nbsp;\r\n        <br/>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div>\r\n        <br/>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- Transactions within the system are treated as \"legal documents\" and therefore can\'t be edited or deleted once posted.&nbsp;\r\n        <br/>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div>\r\n        <br/>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- There is Multi-Level password security in the system, and this is separate from the Operating system security for an extra level of protection.&nbsp;\r\n        <br/>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div>\r\n        <br/>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- The system supports a Purchase approval process and a Payments approval process.&nbsp;\r\n        <br/>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div>\r\n        <br/>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- The system supports the separation of business functions, which is one of the most important requirements.\r\n        <br/>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n    <br/>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>If you have any questions or need any additional information please contact us!&nbsp;\r\n    <br/>\r\n</div>',NULL,NULL),('STFB','DEFAULT','DEFAULT','GettingStarted','Getting Started','WELCOME','SYS',NULL,'            <article>\r\n                    <div><b><span class=\"size\" style=\"font-size:medium\">Integral Accounting Enterprise Getting Started &amp; Installation</span></b> <br></div><p><b>A brief overview of the Integral Accounting Enterprise Getting Started and Installation Guide:</b><br></p><p>The Getting Started and Installation guide discuss the hardware and software requirements that are needed for the Integral Accounting Enterprise system, the development environment necessary to operate and compile the system, and the complete installation instructions.&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p align=\"center\"><span class=\"colour\" style=\"color:rgb(255, 0, 0)\"><b>These documents should be completely reviewed and understood before attempting to install the Integral Accounting Enterprise System.</b></span><br></p><p align=\"center\">&nbsp;<br></p><p><b>About this Help System</b><br></p><p>The help system that is included with the Integral Accounting Enterprise System is separated into four main parts:<br></p><p><b><i>Getting Started &amp; Installation Guide</i></b>&nbsp;- This guide contains all of the information that you need to know in order to Install and Configure the Integral Accounting Enterprise software.

The IAS Book can be purchased from Amazon.\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Like US GAAP, The basic point of IAS compliancy in accounting software is to implement the proper accounting procedures into the software following the guidelines established by the conceptual framework and to have correct financial reporting. The IAS conceptual framework and their other basic rules are very similar to their US GAAP counterparts.\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Also, like US GAAP, the ISA act as guidelines only, and they need to be interpreted and applied to the specific situation and type of company for which the accounting is occurring. Therefore, a thorough understanding of the IAS Conceptual Framework is helpful and recommended.\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>The Conceptual Framework is the foundation for the standards set forth in accounting and from which IAS is written. The Conceptual Framework explains and addresses the concepts of financial accounting such as why orders don\'t post to the GL, or why invoices can\'t be edited under IAS. It also sets forth the basic principles as to the way transactions are recorded, when to record income and expenses, etc. Understanding the conceptual framework will help you understand IAS better and ensure that when you customize and modify the software, it remains IAS compliant. The Wiley IAS Book will help you grasp these issues.&nbsp;\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Like US GAAP, There is no clear-cut checklist that details IAS compliancy.

The stored procedures are passed accounting documents and are then reviewed by the posting procedures to make sure all of the data necessary is accounted for and then the procedure updates the proper accounts in the system.<br></div><div>Stored procedures within the system are designed to be as autonomous as possible, so the same procedures that are called right after a user enters an order for example can also be used, for example, to post EDI Documents automatically without user intervention.<br></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><b>Inventory by Warehouse Table</b><br></div><div>The central location for all item inventory information is the Inventory By Warehouse table. It is very important that you take the utmost care and test a lot when you adjust any code that affects this table or your systems inventory can be adversely affected.<br></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><b>Inventory Costing<br></b>Integral Accounting Enterprise handles FIFO, LIFO, and Average costing methods.You are allowed to select one of these costing methods as the default costing method of your inventory.<b><br></b>Most companies use FIFO costing to manage their inventory. Our system tracks all three inventory costs per item, but only posts the costing you select as your default to the General Ledger.</div><div>Of course, we store all of the Order Information, Invoice information, and all of the Purchase Order Information in the system, so you can implement any kind of costing method you like if these three regular methods don\'t appeal to you.<br></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><b>Defining Inventory Costing in the system</b><br></div><div>You can set the system\'s default costing method in the \"Companies\" table. The field that holds the value is \"DefaultInventoryCostingMethod\" and the values for the field are \"F\" for FIFO (System Default), \"L\" for LIFO, and \"A\" for Average. \"O\", \"E\", and \"C\" are reserved for future use, but you can use any other letter to define custom costing methods within the system.<br></div><div>&nbsp;Costing is calculated using the InventoryLedger table in the system.

The following information details how the Integral Accounting Enterprise system tracks and maintains serial/lot numbers.\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <b>Tracking Serial/Lot Numbers during the Purchasing Process:</b>\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>1. Beginning with the Purchase Order Process, serial/lot numbers are entered on the purchase order. When they are entered, they are stored in the InventorySerialNumbers table related to the InventoryByWarehouse table. In other words, each warehouse bin can have several records in the InventorySerialNumbers table.\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>2. When new inventory is received with serial/lot numbers, it is distributed among the inventory bins using the standard method. If all the inventory items cannot be placed into one bin (including the Overflow bin), then the serial numbers are distributed between bins.\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>3. The quantity of inventory related to a specific serial number is stored in the InventorySerialNumbers.\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>4. The InventorySerialNumbers primary key contains the PurchaseNumber of the purchase for that piece of inventory.\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>5. If the serial/lot number in the new purchase already exists in any bin, the new record to the InventorySerialNumbers table is not added. Instead, InventoryQty is adjusted accordingly.\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <b>Tracking Serial/Lot Numbers during the Ordering Process</b>\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>1. When a new order is created, the serial/lot number for the item being ordered is entered on the order. The system then searches the bin selected on the order for the inventory that has the matching serial/lot number. If the corresponding serial/lot number is not found, serial number field is left empty on the order.\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>2. Inventory is pulled from the inventory bins in the standard method. If there is not enough inventory in one bin to fulfill the order that matches the serial/lot numbers, then the rest of the inventory bins are searched for the corresponding serial/lot number.\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>3. When the order is posted, the current inventory quantity with the corresponding serial/lot number is adjusted accordingly in the InventorySerialNumbers table for each bin where the inventory is being taken out of.\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>',NULL,NULL),('STFB','DEFAULT','DEFAULT','InvoiceProcessing','Invoice Processing Workflow','WORKFLOW','SYS',NULL,' <article>\r\n                    <span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><strong>Invoice Processing</strong></span>\r\n<p>There are several ways that an invoice can be created by the Integral Accounting Enterprise system.

All companies have different year end procedures that they follow, depending on how they set up their accounting systems and their accounting procedures overall. Therefore, it is very difficult to provide a standard year end procedure that works for all companies. This is the \"general\" Integral Accounting Enterprise 2005 Year End Procedure.\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>The first step in the year-end process, is to backup your current database before you do anything else. This should be standard procedure anyway, but it is worth repeating.&nbsp;\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Then, create a new company to hold last years data. To create a new company. You log onto your current company, and make a new company, for example at the end of the year here we will make a new company called \"STFB 20XX\" which will be a copy of the current years data and all records. Then, you would perform the year end procedure on the regular company, which will move all of the records to the history tables, populate the Last Year fields, and it will do some year-end journal adjustments.\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>I would recommend trying this on a trivial company to make sure that you understand it\'s operation before working on the year end.\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Before you do a year-end, you need to close al of the periods. To do a period end, first you would run your trial balance and ensure everything checks out. Then manually enter any adjusting entries as needed. Make sure that all the accounts are closed that are going to be closed and there are no outstanding transactions. This is typically completed by the accountant manually working in the system.\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Next, you go to the period end close screen. Make sure that the current financial period is equal to the period you want to close. From there, press the \"close period button\". The system will close the books for the current period only. If you are closing the current period, there is no need to check the boxes. Keep in mind, that once you close the current period, you cannot go back and close the previous periods. Once the current period is closed and the previous periods remain open, the system is assuming that you are starting the books as of the current period.\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>If you want to close previous periods before closing the current period (in the event that previous periods were not closed but need to be), then the following process would be followed: Go into the company setup screen, change the current period date to be the period you want to close. Next, you go to the period end close screen. From there, check the box next to the older period you want to close (if you are retroactively closing a period, select the one you just changed in the company setup screen) and press the \"close period button\". The system will mark the older period as closed and the remaining periods will be open. You then have to go into the company setup screen and change the period to be the next consecutive period and then close that period before progressing to the current period. If you try to close the periods out of order, the system will not work properly.\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>For example, you can close period 4 (assuming it is the current period) and period 1, but then you MUST go back and close period 2 and 3 before progressing. Another option is you can close period 4 and leave period 1, 2, and 3 open.&nbsp;\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>So basically, there are one of two ways to go about it. You can begin the accounting cycle in the middle of a year, leave the previous periods open and have the year go from the current period to the current period. You can start the accounting cycle at the beginning of the year, retroactively close the previous periods up to the current period, and then continue from there.\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>After closing each period, you can run the financial statements for the current period by going into the Reports - financial statements section and printing out the reports you need. The reports selected from the menu will run the current period reports. The reports can be run by individual period after they are closed.&nbsp;\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Other Questions related to year end:&nbsp;\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <b>How is information about historical periods retained in the system after the end of a fiscal year? Period dates seem to be held against the company record. Is this copied somewhere else when a year is closed?</b>\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>The historical period information is stored in the system according to periods, by year. You can retrieve the information through the GL Transaction History section under General Ledger.\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <b>Could you supply something similar for year end procedures?</b>\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Year end procedures are carried out like period end procedures. There are only two differences. First, you would have to create a copy of the company prior to closing out the year. This gives you a snapshot of the company for the previous year and serves as a backup. The second difference is that all the periods have to be closed prior to closing the year. After the periods have been closed, go to the year close screen (under Ledger Setup, Close Year), and click the “year close” button. You will be asked if you created a copy of the company, and to confirm the year close action. Once you confirm both dialog boxes, the year is closed within the system.\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Next, you go to the company setup, periods screen and update the fiscal start and end date, as well as the current fiscal year and period close dates to the new year. For example, if you are closing out year 2005, upon closing out the year in the system, you go into Company Setup, Periods, and change the fiscal start date to 12/31/2005 and end date to 12/31/2006. The periods would change to Period 1 close date 1/31/06, Period 2 2/28/06, etc.\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>This will prepare you for a new fiscal year and fiscal periods.\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>',NULL,NULL),('STFB','DEFAULT','DEFAULT','LicenseAgreementCompliance','License Agreement Compliance','WELCOME','SYS',NULL,'                <article>\r\n                    <p><b><span class=\"size\" style=\"font-size:medium\">License Agreement Compliance</span></b><br></p><p><b><span class=\"size\" style=\"font-size:small\">Tips on how to comply with the Integral Accounting Enterprise License Agreement</span></b><br></p><p><span class=\"size\" style=\"font-size:small\">1) All reasonable care must be taken to protect the Integral Accounting Enterprise original source code files, and the distribution medium.

Printing on Ink Jet Printers forces the bank\'s processing machines to rely on OCR only to process the check, and this raises the potential for errors. Also, It is not known at this time how many banks are using MICR/OCR and how many are still just using MICR-Only Readers&nbsp; to process checks.<br></p><p>2) Most banks now use a combination of MICR and OCR readers to read the bottom MICR Number line of the check, so if the quality of the paper and the printer is good and you use a laser printer, there there should be no problems. However, if your bank rejects your checks (the bank will still process these checks, but when they are returned to you they will have a sticker at the bottom covering the MICR line with a replacement MICR Strip) you may need to contact a MICR Toner manufacturer and purchase MICR toner for your Laser Printer.<br></p><p>3) This MICR US Font was based on the MICR Character Spacing, Weight, and Size that our Bank (Bank Of America), uses, and was only tested with the Bank Of America, so your results may vary.<br></p><div><br></div>\r\n                </article>',NULL,NULL),('STFB','DEFAULT','DEFAULT','MRPProcessing','MRP Processing Workflow','WORKFLOW','SYS',NULL,'\r\n                <article>\r\n                    <div><b><span class=\"size\" style=\"font-size:medium\">Integral Accounting Enterprise MRP System</span></b> <br></div><p>The Integral Accounting Enterprise system contains many MRP features, including Work Orders, Bills of Materials, Assembly Instructions, Inventory assemblies.<br></p><p>&nbsp;These functions were once separate but are now completely integrated into the Integral Accounting Enterprise system and are available through the \"MRP\" tab from the main menu.<br></p><p>The MRP system is organized in he following manor:<br></p><p><b>Work Orders</b><br></p><p>Work orders an \"order\" from an internal department to build a collection of inventory items using Bills of materials.

Therefore, it is important to take the time now to read this document on the Naming Conventions used in the Integral Accounting Enterprise software so you can easily and efficiently find the fields, tables, stored procedures, web services and forms or screens you need to customize the software.\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Part of the uniqueness of the Integral Accounting Enterprise software is the simplicity used in naming the various tables, fields and screens. You will find that the naming conventions are rather intuitive and after reviewing this document, it should be easy to understand how each table, field and screen is named.\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>First and most important, we use complete word sentences or phrases for the names of fields, screens and tables in the system. For example, an Order Ship Date field in the system would be named OrderShipDate.\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <b>Field Names</b>\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Each field name is a complete word, with the first letter of each word capitalized for easy identification. Field names are named according to the data that will be recorded and entered in that field. They are very simple and intuitive. For example, in an order table, a field that would capture the address where the order is being shipped to would be called ShipToAddress. If there was a second or third field capturing the ship to address, in the case of more then one line needed for the address, it would be named similarly, such as ShipToAddress1 and ShipToAddress2. This indicates that the fields capture similar information all related to the ShipToAddress, but that there are additional lines in the address.\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Another example would be some of the fields found in the Bank Transactions table. Fields such as CurrencyExchangeRate, or BankDocumentNumber mean just that, the currency exchange rate or the bank document number, respectively.\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <b>Table Names</b>\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Tables are named in the same manner as the fields. Each Table name is a complete word or several words, with the first letter of each word capitalized for easy identification. Tables are named according to the data that will be recorded and entered in that Table. They are very simple and intuitive. For example, the table in the system that holds the audit trail is called AuditTrial. Similarly, the name of the table that holds warehouse information is called Warehouses.&nbsp;\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <b>Types Tables</b>\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Types tables are a table where a group of data is stored. Such as order types or credit card types that store all the allowable \"type\" of orders or credit cards within the system. These tables are always named with the name of the types as the first part of the name and the word \"type\" as the second part of the name.\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>For example, the Order Types table which stores all the different \"types\" of orders that are allowed in the system is called OrderTypes. The Bank Transaction Types table which stores all the different \"types\" of Bank Transactions that are allowed in the system is called BankTransactionTypes. Pay close attention to the capitalization in the table name, since that is also used in the naming of each field, screen and table. The capital letters identify a new \"word\" within the name.\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <b>Tables with Related Records</b>\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Many of the tables in the Integral Accounting Enterprise system are related and are designed to have a main table with related \"child\" records. Child records are a record that is part of a main table. For example, all the tables that capture information for an Order are related.&nbsp;\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>The table that has the main information for the function (such as shipping information on an order, etc). would be called the \"Header\" table (since it is the main table). The table that captures and records the detail information for the function (such as the items being ordered on an Order) is called the Detail table. The Header and Detail table are named with their specific function as the first part of the name, just like the Types table.\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>For example, the header table that records the main information for an order is called the OrderHeader table and the table that records the detail information for an Order is called the OrderDetail table. This is consistent throughout the system.&nbsp;\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Another example is the Payment Tables. All the tables capturing information relating to making a payment begin with the word Payment. The second word in the name is the specific table that it refers to. For example, the Payment Header table which records the main information for a payment is called PaymentHeader. The Payment Detail table which records the line items of the payments is called PaymentDetail.&nbsp;\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>All of the tables related to a particular function within the system are given the same prefix. So to use the above examples, all of the tables that are mainly concerned with storing Payment information, being with the word Payment\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <b>Stored Procedures</b>\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Stored Procedures are mini-programs embedded inside SQL Database. They execute tasks when they are called or when certain triggers are activated. The Integral Accounting Enterprise system utilizes Stored Procedures to carry out the functions within the software, such as posting an invoice to the GL after it has been entered and when the Post button is pressed.\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Like the other sections in the Integral Accounting Enterprise system, Stored Procedures are named first by their transaction then by their function such as Transaction_Function. For example, the Stored Procedure that that creates a General Ledger transaction for an Invoice is be called Invoice_CreateGLTransaction. The Invoice_Create indicates that this stored procedure is creating a new GL transaction, as identified by the second half of the name GLTransaction.&nbsp;\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Any web services, core services, controllers, etc, used within the system that are used to call stored procedures use the same naming convention. The transaction is first, followed by an underline to separate the word, then the actual function or task that the routine is doing. A simple way to remember it is: Transaction_Function.Type.\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <b>Models, Views, Controllers, Web Services, Forms, &amp; Other Information about the Naming Conventions</b>\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Following are some important points to keep in mind about the naming convention used in the Integral Accounting Enterprise.\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Everything in the system that is related to each other has the same or similar name.\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>For example, everything that has the same name is somehow related to each other. If you are on some FormSomeEntityX and want to know what web services this form calls, the web service will be namedSomeEntityX, and the database call from that Service (By this we mean the Dataset XSD &amp; VB) will be called SomeEntityX.\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>This method works both forward, working from the forms through the service to the database, and backward, working from the database table in SQL Database and then through the web services to the forms on the front end.&nbsp;\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>This means that if you start at the database table level, and want to see what services and service datasets use that table, the service, service dataset, and the database table will all be named the same or will be named something very similar.\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>You will also see in the system services, service datasets, and in most forms and screens two different forms with the same entity name, SomeEntityX_Detail and SomeEntityX_List. This convention allows you to know if the Entity is operating against a list of records, or against a single record.\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>For example, for services datasets, The _List is returning a list of the records in the dataset, and the _Detail is returning the particular record from the dataset. For forms and screens, The _List displays a list of the records in the dataset on the screen, and the _Detail is returning the particular record from the dataset to the form for editing. Like the other naming conventions used in the system, this is a very simple intuitive method that is easily understood and adjusted to.\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<div>\r\n    <br/>\r\n</div>',NULL,NULL),('STFB','DEFAULT','DEFAULT','OnGoingMaintenance','On Going Maintenance Requirements','TECH','SYS',NULL,'         <article>\r\n                    <div><b><span class=\"size\" style=\"font-size:medium\">On-Going Technical Maintenance</span></b> <br></div><p>On-going maintenance of the Integral Accounting Enterprise package is not much different than any other Accounting / ERP System.

The main purpose of the Sarbanes-Oxley act is to ensure auditors and corporate management both comply with GAAP and have a set of controls in place to prevent fraud.\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Integral Accounting Enterprise has many built in features that allow the software to accommodate the Sarbanes-Oxley requirements.&nbsp;\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>These features include:\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>1. The Integral Accounting Enterprise System keeps a complete audit trail that tracks every change made to every field.\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>2. The system keeps a history of all transactions within the system.\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>3. Any transactions affecting the general ledger cannot be edited or deleted.\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>4. All transactions in the system, like orders, invoices, purchase orders, etc., are treated as “legal documents” and therefore cannot be edited or deleted once posted to the system.\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>5. The system requires passwords usernames and passwords, and supports individual rights assignments to users. Integral Accounting Enterprise password security is separate from the operating system security for an extra level of protection.\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>6. The system supports a purchase approval process. All purchase orders must be approved before they can be vouchered and paid.\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>7. The system supports a payment approval process. All vouchered payments must be approved before they can be paid.\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>8. The system supports the separation of business functions between different users. This is one of the most important requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. For example the system can be configured so that the employees vouchering the payments cannot also print the checks, and Employees ordering inventory cannot also receive inventory, etc.\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>9.

Entering data is a lengthy process that, if done correctly from the beginning, will save many hours of troubleshooting.<br></p><p>The length of time it will take to enter your data into the system will depend on two factors:<br></p><p></p><div>- your previous experience with accounting software<br></div><div>- the state of your current business records<br></div><p></p><p>The set up process outlined in the following pages and the data entering that will be done is typical of the set up requirements for any computerized accounting system. The data that you enter during this phase will serve as the foundation for which all transactions and activity within the system are based upon. Therefore, entering data that is accurate and thorough is vital for the long-term success of your company’s use of Integral Accounting Enterprise.<br></p><p>The following pages are intended to serve as a checklist for you to use when entering data into the system for the first time. Read each step to ensure you have all the information (i.e., notes, paperwork, etc), you need before entering anything into the system and check each box off after you complete each step. All of the sections within Integral Accounting Enterprise are dependent upon each other which means that there is a specific order in which data must be entered. For example, if you receive an order from a customer, but didn\'t enter any inventory, the system will think there is no inventory for the order and the order would go on backorder.<br></p><p>When you are ready to enter your company’s data, start at the beginning of the checklist and work consecutively to the end, without skipping a step unless a step is listed as being optional. Check off each step as it is completed so you know where you left off and what has been entered. Following the order in which the steps appear while entering the data will ensure a solid foundation for your company’s accounting records in the Integral Accounting Enterprise system. As you read through each step, keep in mind that only the basic data that the system needs to properly function is mentioned here. There is a lot more information that can be entered into the system however it is not vital for all the data to be entered in the system at the start. The remaining data can be entered at a later date after the initial start-up information has been entered.<br></p><p>Also note that with each step a short description of the section of data to be entered is included. For further details and/or instructions on a particular section, refer to the corresponding section in the User’s Manual.<br></p><p>This procedure already assumes that you have completed both the Technical Setup and the End-User Configuration sections of this documentation, and that you have already adjusted your \"Default Records\" per the instructions in the End-User Configuration section.&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p><b>Create New Company</b><br></p><p>Log into the Default Company as Admin. You can find the username and password in the database in the PayrollEmployees table, which is where all the user information is stored. When this is done, set the permissions on the Administrator account. To set the permissions, you go to the \"AccessPermissions\" table. Find the Administrator account for the Default / Default / Default Company and set all of the fields to 1.<br></p><p>Go into the System Setup option on the menu, and click “Company Setup”. Click “Company Setup” again and you will see a table with the default company record there. Select “New” and create the new company by entering the company name. Keep in mind that special characters (such as ‘ ! *) are not allowed in the Company name.<br></p><p>Log out of the Default company and log into the newly created company using the username Admin and the corresponding password<br></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p><b>Complete the Company Details screen</b><br></p><p>After you log into the system under the newly created company, click on the System Setup option on the menu, then Company Setup. Click the edit button (the pencil) for the newly created company from the list. Complete the fields on the MAIN screen only (company address, phone, etc.). Do NOT complete the other screens under Company setup at this time. You will return to those screens later in this process and complete them. For now, just enter the basic company information into the Company details screen.&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p><b>Set the Company Default Currency</b><br></p><p>Go into the Company Setup for the new company (if you are not at that screen) and go to the DEFAULTS screen (by clicking the Defaults button at the top of the page). Select your company’s default currency from the drop down list of the first field in the defaults screen. If your company’s default currency is NOT in the drop down list, then it needs to be setup in the Currencies table. Do not complete the other fields on the default screen at this time. You will return to them later.<br></p><p>You can now exit the Company Setup screen and return to the main screen.<br></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p><b>Set Up Multi-Currencies (optional)</b><br></p><p>Complete this step ONLY if your company will be using the multi-currency feature. Otherwise, skip this step and move onto the next one.&nbsp;<br></p><p>If your company will be using the multi-currency feature, review and set up the multi-currencies now. To do this, from the main menu, click on System Setup then Company Setup, then Currencies. You will see a table with the main currency denominations already entered that are shipped with the Integral Accounting Enterprise software. Review the list of currencies to see if there are any currencies that your company deals with that are not listed. If so, enter them now by clicking the “New” button at the top of the screen and entering each denomination as needed.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Once all the currencies that your company needs are entered exit the screen and proceed to the next step.<br></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p><b>Review / Edit the Chart of Accounts</b><br></p><p>The Chart of Accounts is the core of any accounting system. It is a list of all the accounts in the system through which all transactions are recorded.<br></p><p>Integral Accounting Enterprise comes shipped with a default Chart of Accounts that is suitable for most companies. Chances are, most, if not all, of the accounts listed will meet your company’s needs. Review the default Chart of Accounts by clicking General Ledger from the main menu, then View Chart of Accounts. This will bring up the Chart of Accounts which you can review and add accounts as needed. When you are finished reviewing and/or editing the Chart of Accounts, exit the screen and return to the main menu.<br></p><p>Note: It is strongly recommended that you review the documentation on the Chart of Accounts before setting up any new accounts.<br></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p><b>Create a GL Account for each Bank Account</b><br></p><p>Next, create a GL cash account in the Chart of Accounts for each bank account that your company is currently using. In keeping with the standard numbering system of the Chart of Accounts, all cash accounts should begin with the number one (i.e., 115000) since they are asset accounts. <i><b>Keep in mind that each bank account can only be associated with ONE GL bank account</b></i><b>.</b><br></p><p>Note: It is strongly recommended that you review the documentation on the Chart of Accounts before setting up any new accounts.<br></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p><b>Set up Bank Accounts</b><br></p><p>Now that your GL and Chart of Accounts are properly set up to match your company’s needs, the next step is to enter and set up your company’s bank accounts. This section is used by the system to record deposits, checks that are written, and to view the transactions for that bank account.<br></p><p>Note: The Bank ID must be unique for each bank account and a unique GL account must be selected and/or created for each Bank account. You cannot assign more then one bank account to a single GL Account. Therefore, be sure that there is a separate GL Account set up for each bank account you have.<br></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p><b>Review and Edit Data used by the System</b><br></p><p>This step is a simple but required step nonetheless. From the main menu, click on System Setup then General Ledger setup. One by one, click on EACH screen (bank types, transaction types, etc) and review them carefully. While reviewing them, be sure they conform to your company’s method of doing business. If there are any “types” not listed that your company uses, enter them now. If everything is acceptable, then close the screens and move onto the next step.<br></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p><b>Review and Set Up Company Document Numbers</b><br></p><p>For this step, you need to have a list of your company’s current Document ID numbers (i.e., the next consecutive invoice number, check number, etc). After you have a list of your company’s current Document ID numbers, review the document numbers in the system and match them to the ones your company is using or set them to a starting number that your company will use.&nbsp;<br></p><p>To review the company document numbers, go to System Setup then Company Setup from the main menu then click the Company ID Numbers option. This will bring up a table with the default document types and document numbers that come shipped with the system. From there you can edit the existing starting numbers.<br></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p><b>Review and enter Default Billing Terms</b><br></p><p>Next, review and enter the default billing terms that your company uses. Go to System Setup then Company Setup and click the Terms option. A table will come up with the default billing terms already shipped with the system. Review these billing terms to see if they meet the needs of your company. From this screen you can edit the existing terms and/or add new billing terms as needed.<br></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p><b>Review and Set Up Tax Items, Details and Groups</b><br></p><p>The next step is to review and set up the tax items, details and groups that your company uses. Before doing so, it is important to know what each classification is.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Tax items are the individual taxing authorities set by various local, county and state governments. On the Tax Item screen, the tax percent for that authority and the GL Account where the tax is posted is displayed and recorded. Each tax authority should have its own GL Account to properly record the tax.<br></p><p>Tax Group Details are a collection of one or more tax items grouped together (i.e., a particular state and county sales tax would be one tax group detail) All the tax items need to be organized into a tax group to be properly applied to sales and purchases (VAT tax) in the system.<br></p><p>Tax Groups are collections of two or more tax group details. For example, a county tax group detail and state tax group detail can be grouped together for a particular state to form a tax group for that state.<br></p><p>Starting with the tax items, go through the taxes that your company deals with and enter them in the Tax Items screen. Once that is complete, go to the tax group details screen and group the tax items into groups according to the organization and classification your company uses for the tax authorities. Repeat the same procedure for tax groups.<br></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p><b>Review and Edit Credit Card Types</b><br></p><p>Under Company Setup, select the Credit Card Types option to review the credit card types entered in the system that your company accepts. A screen will be displayed that includes a few default credit card types that are shipped with the system. Add additional credit cards that your company accepts or edit the existing ones that are already in the system.&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p><b>Review and Edit Shipment Methods</b><br></p><p>Under Company Setup, select the Shipment Methods option to review and edit the shipment methods your company uses. After clicking the option for Shipment Methods, a table will be displayed that shows the default shipment methods that come with the system. Edit and/or add the shipment methods your company uses (such as UPS Next Day Air, Airborne Express, FedEx Standard, etc).<br></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p><b>Review and Edit Project Types (optional)</b><br></p><p>Project Types are different types of projects that your company has to classify certain transactions. This step is optional depending on if your company uses project types. There are a few basic default project types that come shipped with the system. You can review and edit this table (if necessary) by selecting System Setup from the main menu then Company Setup and clicking on the option for Project Types.&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p><b>Review and Edit Inventory Adjustment Types</b><br></p><p>Inventory Adjustment Types are the various types of inventory adjustment classifications that are used for recording and organizing inventory adjustments in the system. Review the list of inventory adjustments types that comes shipped with the system and match them to the inventory adjustment types that your company uses.<br></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p><b>Review and Set Up Contact Industries, Regions, Sources and Types (optional)</b><br></p><p>If your company will be using the Lead Management System in the Integral Accounting Enterprise and your company classifies leads by industries, regions, sources and types, then review and edit these sections as needed. Each Contact “type” is a separate option which can be accessed by clicking on System Setup from the main menu then Company Setup.<br></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p><b>Review and Set Up Company Warehouses</b><br></p><p>The next step is to set up your company’s warehouses. Under Company Setup, click the option for Warehouses and enter the company warehouses and their respective information for each warehouse your company uses.&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p><b>Set Up Warehouse Bin Zones (optional)</b><br></p><p>If your company’s warehouse(s) organize inventory bins by zone, then set up the warehouse bin zones now. This is an optional step and is not required by the system. It is used for your company’s organization and record-keeping purposes only.<br></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p><b>Set up Warehouse Bin Types</b><br></p><p>After the warehouses have been entered, the next step is to set up the type of warehouse bins. It is recommended that at least two bin types (a default bin and overflow bin) be set up. Additional warehouse bin types can be entered if needed, but at least one type needs to be entered and specified.<br></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p><b>Set Up Warehouse Bins</b><br></p><p>Warehouse Bins specify where the inventory goes once it enters the warehouse. Each warehouse needs to have at least ONE Warehouse Bin. Enter one warehouse bin for each warehouse that was set up in the system. Enter additional bins per warehouse if needed based on the organization of your company’s warehouses.<br></p><p>Most of the fields in the warehouse bin screen are for internal tracking and locating purposes and do not need data entered into them for the system to use. However, the following fields DO need to be entered for use by the system based on inventory processing rules that rely on the bin setup.<br></p><p>Minimum bin quantity: This field specifies the minimum amount of goods that should be left in the bin. Enter the amount that your company requires to be on hand in that particular bin at all times.<br></p><p>Maximum bin quantity: This field specifies the maximum amount of items that the bin can hold and must be set to a number. If the number of items the bin can hold is unlimited, it can be set to 99999 or greater.<br></p><p>Overflow Bin: This field defines the Overflow Bin. If a particular bin has too many goods in it, the overflow bin is where excess inventory is stored once the previous bin is filled up. Specify the name of the overflow bin that you entered at the beginning of this step.<br></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p><b>Set up Employee Records</b><br></p><p>From the main menu, click Employees then click Enter and View Employees. From here, you can enter the company’s employees.<br></p><p>There are three default sign-ins automatically created for each company. First, it is advisable to change these passwords so that they can’t be tampered with by unauthorized personnel.<br></p><p>Next, enter your company’s employees here. For now, you only need to enter the employees that will be logging into the system to help with the setup and testing procedures. The remaining employees’ information can be entered at a later date.<br></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p><b>Set up Employee Security</b><br></p><p>Under Company Setup is the option Security Setup. By default, only the system administrator will have access to this screen. In order to change the security options for the various employee log ins, log in as the system administrator then edit and/or create a security record for each employee that will be accessing the system. The Security Level field is an optional field that is not used by the system. If you want to implement a custom built, simple security system, the security level field can be used to define access levels for users. All the other fields in this table have specific meanings within the system.<br></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p><b>Enter the Default Data on the Company Setup Screen</b><br></p><p>Now that the basic information has been entered, the next step is to go back to the Company Setup screen and enter the remaining default values on the Default Screen and the other screens in the Company Setup section. It is extremely important that ALL of the screens in the Company Setup section are COMPLETELY filled in, especially the GL Accounts and Accounting Periods before progressing onto the next step and before ANY transactions are entered into the system.<br></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p><b>Enter and Set Up Vendor Records</b><br></p><p>You are now ready to begin entering information about the vendors your company does business with. From the main menu, click on Vendors then click on the option Enter and View Vendors. Enter the information for the vendor on the Main screen as well as the information in the remaining screens at this time also. Vendor Financials and Vendor Contacts are separate options that are accessed from he main menu and must also be set up at this time.<br></p><p>Be sure to complete the Remittance section and the Default section during this step, especially the shipment method and GL Purchase account on the Default Section. These sections are used by the system when transactions are processed.<br></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p><b>Enter Company Inventory</b><br></p><p>The Integral Accounting Enterprise system has several ways of classifying inventory in order to help you track, organize, report, and present items to customers in a manageable way. The main inventory classification is Item families (for example, Hewlett Packard). Item families have categories which could be a class of an item (for example, printers or fax machines). Categories have individual items within them (for example, a list of printers).<br></p><p>The first thing to do is check the Item Types (from the main menu under Inventory) and review and/or edit or add item types as need be to match the item types your company uses. After this is done, set up the Item Families for the inventory, then Item Categories, then Items. When entering individual items, there is a certain amount of required data that the system needs first. The remaining data can be entered at a later date. Following is the required data that needs to be entered now:<br></p><p>Main inventory screen: On this screen, enter the unique item id, select whether or not the item is active, select the type and enter the category ID.<br></p><p>Detail Screen: Enter the default warehouse for the item and the default warehouse bin for the item.<br></p><p>Price and Cost Screen: A GL Sales account must be selected. Select the GL Cost of Goods (COGS) account and GL Inventory account for THIS particular item. Each item will have a GL COGS and Sales account specified. Enter the default price where it says price, and enter the starting LIFO (last in first out) FIFO (first in first out) and average costs for this item if necessary. Enter the initial value for the item where it says starting LIFO, FIFO and Average Values.&nbsp;<br></p><p>That is all that is required for inventory setup at this time.&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p><b>Entering Inventory Quantity</b><br></p><p>From the Inventory On Hand screen, enter the initial inventory your company has on hand. It is recommended to use either a count sheet, or recent inventory records that indicate each item, the bin and warehouse where the item is stored. For each inventory item your company has, specify the bin and warehouse then enter the quantity on hand.<br></p><p>Note: If your company has a large number of items, warehouse bins, or warehouses, you may want to enter the inventory into the system in an automated manner.<br></p><p>Inventory and inventory quantity on hand MUST be entered before any transactions are entered into the system. If you do not enter inventory, all orders will be placed on back order and will need to be reallocated to be fulfilled.<br></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p><b>Set Up Customers</b><br></p><p>If you have an existing customer list for your company, use that list to enter your company’s customers. From the Customers option on the main menu, select the option Enter and View Customers. From that screen, enter each customer’s basic information on the Main Customer Screen. On the customer Info screen, select customer sales account, default terms for that customer, and the employee ID of either the salesman or that customer’s default customer service rep (if there is one).<br></p><p>Enter the information for the remaining screens at this time also. Customer Financials and Customer Contacts are separate options that are accessed from the main menu and must also be set up at this time.<br></p><p>Be sure to complete a financial record with a credit limit for each customer under the Customer Financials section from the Customer option on the Main Menu. If no credit limit is entered, all customer orders will be put on hold. Enter the ship to and ship for info for this customer as well.<br></p><p>If you are tracking credit references, contacts, comments, etc., you can enter that information now. Entering the credit references, contact information and comments are optional and are not required by the system.&nbsp;<br></p><p>After keying in customer ship to and ship for addresses, go back to the customer record and specify the default ship to and ship for addresses for this customer as well as a default ship method and the default warehouse that the customer’s goods come from. If the customer has special items and special item pricing with your company, enter the item and price cross reference AFTER keying in inventory items.<br></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p><b>Set Up Company Leads (optional)</b><br></p><p>If your company will be using the Leads Management System, you can enter company leads now if you want. Entering leads are not required by the system and can be entered at a later point. However, if at any time your company does with to track leads, be sure to complete the contact industry, sources, etc. screens that was mentioned in an earlier step.<br></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p><b>Set up Accounts Payable</b><br></p><p>From the main menu, go to System Setup then Accounts Payable. At this screen, click on the option for the Accounts Payable Transaction Types. A screen will be displayed that lists the default types of payables that are shipped with the system. Review the list and enter or edit the types to meet those that your company uses.<br></p><p>Next, go to the main Accounts Payable menu and select Enter and View Purchases from the menu. This will bring up a table with sample purchase orders displayed and a Default Record displayed. Select the Default Record to review the default purchase order. The Default Record for the purchase order will tell the system what will be automatically filled in each time a new purchase order is entered. Review this record to be sure that the default fields that are automatically populated correspond to your company’s default values for a Purchase Order. If the information needs to be changed, you can change it on that screen and click OK when finished. The system will then save the default record which will be used when new Purchase Orders are entered.<br></p><p>Repeat the above process for the payments by selecting Enter and View Payments from the Accounts Payable option on the main menu. A table with sample payments will be displayed. Select the Default Record to review the default payment. The Default Record for the payment will tell the system what will automatically be filled in each time a new payment is entered. Review this record to be sure that the default fields that are automatically populated correspond with your company’s default values for a new Payment. If the information needs to be changed, you can change it on that screen and click OK when finished. The system will then save the default record which will be used when new Payments are entered.<br></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p><b>Set up Accounts Receivable</b><br></p><p>From the main menu, go to System Setup then Accounts Receivable. At this screen, click on the option for the Accounts Receivable Transaction Types. A screen will be displayed that lists the default types of receivables that are shipped with the system.

This will bring up a list of sample orders that shipped with the system. Select the Default Record to review the default order. The Default Record for the order will tell the system what will automatically be completed each time a new order is entered. Review this record to be sure that the default fields that are automatically populated correspond with your company’s default values for a new Order. If the information needs to be changed, you can change it on that screen and click OK when finished. The system will then save the default record which will be used when new Orders are entered.<br></p><p>Repeat the above step for Quote, Invoice, Contract and Cash Receipts to be sure that the default data for each form matches the default data that your company uses when creating a new transaction.<br></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p><b>Enter General Ledger Beginning Balances</b><br></p><p>The next step is to enter the beginning balances for all the General Ledger (GL) accounts. Enter the balances by selecting the General Ledger Tab, selecting Ledger then going into the Ledger Transaction Screen, and entering a General Ledger transaction for each of the accounts that has a balance in the system.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Keep in mind that these transactions are used as the starting point for all financial information in the system. They should accurately reflect the existing balances in your current GL regardless if you are starting fresh from scratch or converting an existing system.<br></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p><b>Congratulations!</b><br></p><p>You have completed the basic set up of the Integral Accounting Enterprise system.<br></p><p>Since you finished the set up for main company and the information related to the main company, if you are going to be setting up any division or departments, you can set those up now.<br></p><p>As was mentioned at the beginning of this checklist document, you only entered the basic data that the system needs to properly function. Now that the basic data has been entered, your system is ready for testing. It is suggested that thorough testing be conducted to ensure the default values in the system match those that your company uses and to ensure that the data entered during the set up process is correct.<br></p><p>When conducting testing on the system, it is strongly recommended that information specific to your company and sample transactions that are indicative of your company’s transactions be used. The purpose of testing is to ensure that you have properly set up the system to meet your company’s needs and the way your company does business. Also, it is important to test the system to see if there are any areas which need to be customized or changed to meet your company’s needs.<br></p><p>After testing is complete, the remaining data can be entered that was not initially entered during the above set up process.<br></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p>\r\n                </article>',NULL,NULL),('STFB','DEFAULT','DEFAULT','TaxSetupTaxGroup','Tax Setup - Tax Groups','USER','SET',NULL,'<div>\r\n    <b>\r\n        <span class=\"size\" style=\"font-size:medium\">Tax Groups</span>\r\n    </b>\r\n    <br/>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>Tax Groups are collections of Tax Group Details.

Each of the above documents details how specific sections work in the system, provides insight into the fields on the screens, and gives insight into the architecture of the Integral Accounting Enterprise.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Next, review and familiarize yourself with the Integral Accounting Enterprise system database back end to confirm the system has all the tables and fields needed by the company and or client. If necessary, add the requested tables and fields during this review. The database schema and modification guide included with the Help Documentation contains additional information about this process.<br></p><p>You may want to make a checklist of these points and have someone sign off on them as they are completed.<br></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p><b>Screen Review/User Interface Review</b><br></p><p>The Integral Accounting Enterprise system comes with many user screens and an extensive number of input fields on those screens. Not all users will need all the screens or all the fields. You should review these screens and fields to determine what the customer needs and modify the software to remove or add the necessary screens or fields. This is not a required step, rather a recommendation that will make the end-user interface cleaner and easier to use and understand.<br></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p><b>Transaction Review</b><br></p><p>Review the following main transactions that companies regularly perform to ensure the screens and procedures as written in the documentation and system meet your company and/or client’s needs:<br></p><ul><li>Order / Invoice Processing<br></li><li>Purchasing / Receiving Processing<br></li><li>Cash Receipts / Cash Payments Processing<br></li></ul><p>Detailed documentation of each of the above procedures can be found in the User Documentation. After reviewing the above list of transactions, customize and adjust any screens, fields, tables, etc., as necessary to meet the company or client’s needs.<br></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p><b>Reports</b><br></p><p>Since Reports are the most highly-customized and specifically tailored section of the software this step is an important one. Review the reports and report formats to determine if any of the reports need to be modified for the company and/or client’s use. This is normally an area where the customer has certain requirements that need to be included on the reports (i.e., specific format, logo included, etc.), and implemented in the software. Print sample copies of the reports to present to the customer for their review and formatting according to their standards.<br></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p><b>Error Reporting</b><br></p><p>Please go to the web.config files and the other configuration files and update any settings there to point to your servers instead of ours. The system comes with an error reporting tool that will automatically email errors to the system administrator. For this to work properly, you need to change the default email and SMTP server settings in the configuration files to point to your email and SMTP server..<br></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p><b>Check Printing</b><br></p><p>Even though the checks in the Integral Accounting Enterprise use a standard format, there may be some adjustments needed to align them properly on the page. For example, each printer has its own set of margins which have to be accounted for in the Check Printing Program. Take the time now to print a sample check on the printer where the checks will be normally printed and correct the margins as needed. Also review the Technical Reference Guide for further information on MICR check printing. Generally Checks MUST be printed on a Laser printer using toner in order to be read by the banks systems.&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p><b>Security Review</b><br></p><p>It is very important that you review the security for the system before allowing it to run in a live environment. You may want to limit access to certain areas or remove functions from the program completely.&nbsp;<br></p><p>The Integral Accounting Enterprise package has a very good security implemented within it that defines functions by user, and allows only certain users to have access to certain screens and is completely configurable and very easy to Modify. <br></p><div><b>However,</b> many of the security settings are set to \"low\" by default, this eases testing and development during the customization phase. So, it is very important that <b>BEFORE</b> you implement the system <b>IN A LIVE ENVIRONMENT</b> you should review the software security and make 100% sure that the security is setup properly for your organization!<br></div><div><br></div><div>You may want to pay particular attention to how data is stored in your database, and check the reports and make sure that no one that should not have access gets access to these reports. Day - To Day users most likely should not have access to the reports or the reports engine at all.<br></div><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p><b>Audit Trail</b><br></p><p>The Integral Accounting Enterprise system automatically audits each change to each record in the system as it happens and logs these changes to the Audit Trail tables. These Audit Trail tables get very large very fast, so you will need to have a plan in place to deal with these records. If you do not use or need the audit trail, then we recommend that you simple purge these tables on either a weekly or a monthly basis depending on your transaction volume. If you need to keep all of your audit trail records, then we recommend that you dump the audit trail tables to an delimited text or an xml file on a monthly basis and save them to an optical or cartridge drive, so that they can be quickly found and reloaded into an RDBMS quickly if needed.<br></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p><b>Final Preparation</b><br></p><p>At this point, most of your preparation work as Systems Administrator has been completed. Make sure that all of the technical and accounting information is documented by the company or client and ready for entering into the system.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Determine if the starting data is going to be keyed-in or if custom import screens and routines are needed. If the data is going to be keyed-in, work with the company or client to ensure the data entry is completed smoothly and error free. If custom import screens and routines are needed, then they should be completed before moving onto the next step.<br></p><div><br></div>\r\n                </article>',NULL,NULL),('STFB','DEFAULT','DEFAULT','TechnicalReferenceGuide','Technical Reference Guide','TECH','SYS',NULL,'<div>\r\n    <b>\r\n        <span class=\"size\" style=\"font-size:medium\">Integral Accounting Enterprise Technical Reference Guide</span>\r\n    </b>\r\n    <br/>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n    <b>A brief overview of the Integral Accounting Enterprise Technical Reference Guide:</b>\r\n    <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>The Technical Reference guide contains information on the architecture and design of the system, and documents detailing some system functions and discussions on naming conventions and version control.
